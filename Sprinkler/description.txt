1) Consider a system to control a sprinkler. The purpose of this system is to adjust the operating
time of the sprinkler (short, medium, long). The outside sensors give information about the air
temperature (very cold, cold, normal, warm, hot) and the humidity of the soil (dry, normal, wet). Compute
the necessary operating time of the sprinkler according to the input data

Input data:
	Temperature
		T:{very cold, cold normal, warm, hot}
		A:{a| 0<=a<=1}
	Humidity
		H:{dry, normal, wet}
		B:{b| 0<=b<=1}
Output data
	Time= time of sprinkle
		T:{short, medium, long}
